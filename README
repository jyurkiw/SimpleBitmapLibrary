Simple Bitmap Library
by Jeffrey Yurkiw
Version: 0.1

A simple C++ library for writing bitmap images to file.

All the useful stuff is in src/bmp.h and src/bmp.cpp.
src/writeBitmap.cpp is good for a basic use example, but not much else.

All code in this project is based off of the bitmap file format
information present at http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BMP_file_format

Currently the library supports the 24-bit 8.8.8.0.0 format and only
writes to file.
