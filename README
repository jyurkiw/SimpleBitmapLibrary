Simple Bitmap Library
by Jeffrey Yurkiw
Version: 0.0.1

A simple C++ library for writing bitmap images to file.

All the useful stuff is in src/bmp.h and src/bmp.cpp.
src/writeBitmap.cpp is good for a basic use example, but not much else.

All code in this project is based off of the bitmap file format
information present at http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BMP_file_format

Currently the library supports the 24-bit 8.8.8.0.0 format and currently does
not write to file.

Goals:
	1.0.0 - Write a 24-bit bitmap to file that can be opened and edited in
		  The GIMP with full public member UnitTesting for basic functionality.

Documentation:
	Use Doxygen. Just do it.
	You will need to install vizgraph unless you want to turn off the pretty,
	pretty diagrams.

ECLIPSE:
	Use git to download this project from github into your eclipse workbench
	Open Eclipse
	Right-click on your Project Explorer and select New -> Project...
	Create a "Makefile Project With Existing Code"
		(should be one of the default CDT new project options)
	Name the new project "SimpleBitmapLibrary"
	Browse to the same folder in the Existing Code Location field
	Select your Toolchain and language(s)
	Click Okay
	Win!
	
	You may have to tell eclipse what executable to run. To do that go into
	your project properties and create a new run/debug target in your
	project's Run/Debug Settings.

DEBUGGING:
	The makefile has support for Valgrind. If you have it installed
	the command is "make valgrind". That will build a .valgrind
	executable and a series of .valgrind object files in the build
	directory that are compiled with full debugging flags enabled.
	
	There are some unit tests defined for a number of private class
	members. This is done via the UNITTEST precompiler flag.
	Currently this flag is used with the MAKE ALL command and valgrind.
	Will be removed in non-valgrind builds when the make file gets
	rewritten.
