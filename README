Simple Bitmap Library
by Jeffrey Yurkiw
Version: 0.1

A simple C++ library for writing bitmap images to file.

All the useful stuff is in src/bmp.h and src/bmp.cpp.
src/writeBitmap.cpp is good for a basic use example, but not much else.

All code in this project is based off of the bitmap file format
information present at http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BMP_file_format

Currently the library supports the 24-bit 8.8.8.0.0 format and only
writes to file.

Documentation:
	Use Doxygen. Just do it.

ECLIPSE:
	The makefile doesn't create a binary that is compatable with default eclipse behavior.
Unless you want to run it manually do the following...
	Right-click on the project in the project explorer OR go to Project -> Properties
	Go to the Run/Debug Settings menu in the properties dialog
	Delete the auto-generated SimpleBitmapLibrary entry
	Click on the New... button
	It should auto-populate based on your makefile. If it doesn't, browse to the
		binary in the project's bin directory (you'll need to build it)
	Click "Okay"
